### Description
Todays,people are more productive and technologicaly they are advancing in their minds and that is why technological ideas were implementing.keepng these things mind there is no fully authorised security and surveillencing robot available.It looks more comfortable when its an pet.A robocat will ensures all these factors and integrating it with alexa will be more good that means a walking alexa is loading.Apart from this just like how a dog guards the home the cat can look after the house.The system consist of hardware with 3D models comprising of a set of sensors and servos.Being a robot, it may not be tamed as per the need of the individual but the programming and coding have done on the software however have made a tamed approach towards the people.It will detect the obstacles,senses gas leakage, and also it play with childrens. It is an dynamic embedded system which is powered by a battery and it can be stand upto 3 hours.
So whenever there is no one at home it will act as security.
