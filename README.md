### Description
A **robotic cat** which act as both security and an assistant, and finally a pet.Its not only a robotic cat that walks, itâ€™s a new type of pet which **senses the danger, senses the strangers, play with children, and also help the age old people. It has ability to move and detect the obstacles. It has ability to balanced in any slope surface. Its just only a base model and advanced is yet to come with more features and user friendly. Advanced model  will be integrated with alexa means an walking alexa is loading. Integrating it with with a voice assistant (like alexa),it will guided through your daily routine. so it will be more usefull to age old peoples**. So as in the base model we only focus on its motions like balancing, controling ,detecting and some extra features. The system consist of hardware with 3D models comprising of a set of sensors and servos.Being a robot, it may not be tamed as per the need of the individual but the programming and coding have done on the software however have made a tamed approach towards the people.It will detect the obstacles,senses gas leakage, and also it play with childrens. It is an dynamic embedded system which is powered by a battery and it can be stand upto 3 hours.
So whenever there is no one at home it will act as security. 

### Importance
The advantage of security and surveillencing robocat is that the device with automation and hardware could behave and blend well with human users. The area of interest will be changed here as the product can maintain a proper communication settlement here. Apart from this just like how a dog guards the home the product here, we introduce will be able to maintain a blueprint sketch of the house or building and can have an eye on nook and corner. the programing has done on arduino ide and raspberry pi makes it more user- friendly. When the device can communicate through audio responses and respond to various other audios (distinguish sounds), apparently would gain into the favorite list of the user, apart from this the security enhancement is another factor which is a key point.
